SUMMA CONTROL SERVER DESIGN DOCUMENTATION
=======================================

Control Main Tasks
----------------

 S1) Provide a centralized configuration system
 S2) Provide centralized client and service management interface
 S3) Provide a repository for service and client bundles

Distributed Design
------------------
Each responsibility S1, S2, S3 runs in a separate process to maximize
stability. In addition to this a core process run that exposes a remote
interface that gives easy access to the other three services.

It is the responsibility of the core to keep S1-S3 running, starting and
stopping on request.

All connections must be stateless to make sure individual components of the
system can be managed manually. For this all communications must facilitate
a dk.statsbiblioteket.util.rpc.ConnectionManager from the sbutil package.
