	* [r1872] .[CPY]:
	  
	  Tag Summa 1.4.11. We still need to roll back some stuff before we
	  can release 1.4.11

2009-10-22 10:41  mkamstrup

	* [r1871]
	  
	  Fix bug #65: "ZipException: invalid bit length repeat; during
	  ingest". The trick is to ensure that all operations on the
	  ZipInputStream happen in the same thread. This is achieved by
	  implementing a QueuedInputStream that holds an internal blocking
	  queue all data is pushed over. There's a lot of room for
	  optimization here, see the fixme in the header for
	  QueuedInputStream

2009-10-20 12:37  mkamstrup

	* [r1870]
	  
	  ahInclude a zip thread-stress class, UnzipThread, but
	  unfortunately it passes all tests...

2009-10-20 12:36  mkamstrup

	* [r1869]
	  
	  Add note about a race condition that might be related to bug #65

2009-10-19 11:33  toke-sb

	  danske aviser opdateringer

2009-10-13 09:29  mkamstrup

	* [r1865]
	  
	  Add some tests for the StreamController class - I had expected to
	  reproduce some errors I just saw on metis, but the tests pass
	  fine...
	  
	  Add some helper constructors to the PayloadFiller
	  ThreadStreamParser implementation used for tests

2009-10-13 08:09  mkamstrup

	* [r1864]
	  
	  Fix bug #64: "Race condition when exceeding queue size of
	  ThreadedStreamParser". Don't use BlockingQueue.add() to add the
	  final poison element to the queue when run() is returning as it
	  throws an IllegalStateException when the queue is full. Use
	  BlockingQueue.put() instead (specifically use
	  ThreadedStreamParser.addToQueue()) this call will block until
	  there is room

2009-10-13 08:00  mkamstrup

	* [r1863]
	  
	  Add methods to ThreadedStreamParser to check if any errors has
	  been collected asynchrnously in the parser's thread. Before this
	  uncaught exceptions from the parser's thread where simply
	  dropped. New public method getLastError() to inspect this.
	  
	  Use this functionality in the unit tests for TSP - revealing a
	  race condition when exceeding the queue size

2009-10-12 10:10  mkamstrup

	* [r1862]
	  
	  Fix bug #61: "Whitespace garbage in suggest strings".
	  
	  The SuggestStorageH2 class now features a "query sanitizer"
	  (which is a
	  configurable class of Lucene Analyzer controlled by the property
	  summa.support.suggest.sanitizer) that will be run over user
	  queries
	  to be added to the DB. The default is a Lucene WhitespaceAnalyzer
	  which
	  will result in the fix for the bug mentioned above

2009-10-09 14:30  toke-sb

	* [r1861]
	  
	  Optimization: Replaced the busy-wait in ThreadedStreamParser with
	  a blocking wait on PayloadQueue. Here be dragons, as there is the
	  possibility of dead-locking. The unit-tests runs and so does our
	  deploy-tests, but further reviews are advised

2009-10-09 13:02  mkamstrup

	* [r1860]
	  
	  WARNING: Another DB schema changoe for the suggest service -
	  Sorry! Fix bug #63: "Suggestions with same normalized key show
	  same hitcount". I added some unit tests for this as well as did
	  some full-scale testing on a 1M suggestions dump of data from our
	  live systems; seems to work well, although query execution time
	  seems to have dropped slightly...

	* [r1749]
	  
	  Performance: Introduces max rows setting to h2 backend for
	  suggest, ensuring lower response times for parts of a large
	  result set (for example single character prefixes)

2009-09-01 12:18  mkamstrup

	* [r1747]
	  
	  Release Summa 1.4.9

2009-09-01 12:11  toke-sb

	* [r1746]
	  
	  Testing: The ClearBaseFilter with PayloadMatcher now has a unit
	  test

2009-09-01 11:06  mkamstrup

	* [r1745]
	  
	  Feature: Add a new .jar file to the distribution,
	  summa-standalone-${summa.version}.jar, containing all summa libs
	  and dependencies. Stand Alone is the word

2009-09-01 09:46  toke-sb

	* [r1744]
	  
	  Feature: Added matching on key and value on Payload and embedded

	  Refactoring: Extracted the Payload-matching code from
	  RegexpFilter

2009-09-01 07:49  toke-sb

	* [r1741]
	  
	  Bugfix: the PayloadQueue unpacked all compressed content when it
	  checked for size

2009-08-31 14:07  toke-sb

	* [r1740]
	  
	  Performance: The H2-based Suggest storage now performs an alazyle
	  upon startup and after each 10,000 updates. The analyze is quick
	  for the suggest-corpus at Statsbiblioteket (< 1 second) and seems
	  to improve lookup performance considerably

2009-08-31 12:21  mkamstrup

	* [r1739]
	  
	  Tests: Do some interaction tests with RemoteHelper. Among other
	  interesting stuff this reveals that OOM pass cascade directly
	  from the server process to the calling client process... Scary...

2009-08-31 11:39  mkamstrup

	* [r1738]
	  
	  Bugfix: Log uncaught exceptions in the RecordBatcher thread in
	  the RecordWriter filter

2009-08-31 11:37  mkamstrup

	* [r1737]
	  
	  Bugfix: In DatabaseStorage explicitly rollback connections with
	  any errors detected (the rollbacks where implicit from closing
	  the connection before - this is not good JDBC behaviour)

2009-08-28 12:45  toke-sb

	* [r1735]
	  
	  Testing: Updated test for a large amount (5M) of tiny Records in

	  Bugfix: Bundle Tool should escape property refs inside <jvmArg>
	  tags

2009-08-27 11:15  toke-sb

	* [r1719]
	  
	  Testing: StorageMonkeyHelper now uses StorageWriterClient and
	  StorageReaderClient in order to perform remote connections to
	  Storage

2009-08-27 07:49  mkamstrup

	* [r1718]
	  
	  Bugfix: Fix db connection leak in flushAll() when we fail to set
	  the connection in write-mode. This is categorized as a
	  corner-case bug, but a bug nonetheless
	  
	  Performance fix: Small performance regression in
	  H2Storage.touchParents() where we allocate a HashSet even when we
	  might not need it

2009-08-26 11:14  toke-sb

	* [r1711]
	  
	  Testing: More work on Storage monkey

2009-08-26 09:13  toke-sb

	  uninterrupted ingests

2009-08-26 09:04  toke-sb

	  Testing: Added monkey test for Storage

2009-08-25 10:08  mkamstrup

	* [r1704]
	  
	  Performance: Enable the H2 second level LRU cache by default.
	  This should speed up large bases, but might be a small hit for
	  smaller bases. This feature can be controlled via the
	  summa.storage.database.l2cache boolean property

2009-08-21 12:58  toke-sb

	* [r1699]
	  
	  Testing: Added unit-test for TikaDocumentCreator

2009-08-19 22:11  toke-sb

	  Work in progress: Skeleton classes for native ARC support

2009-08-19 21:56  toke-sb

	* [r1685]
	  
	  Feature: Made it optionable to close the underlying stream in

	  from Stream->Stream split filters

2009-08-19 21:55  toke-sb

	* [r1684]
	  
	  Logging: Better statistics from the TikaDocumentCreator

	* [r1683]
	  
	  danske aviser opdateringer

2009-08-19 09:40  toke-sb

	* [r1682]
	  
	  Enhancement: when specifying a static root for SummasearcherImpl,
	  it will now be expanded with Resolver.getPersistentFile instead
	  of being used directly. This manes it trivial to place the
	  suggest-data under the default persistent folder

2009-08-18 12:05  mkamstrup

	* [r1681]
	  
	  Fix bad release date for 1.4.8 mentionedd in the NEWS file. The

	  Add the Tika jar to the deps of the Support module (needed by the
	  new TikaDocumentCreator)

2009-08-15 01:07  toke-sb

	* [r1674]
	  
	  Enhancement: Closed the ARC record stream ASAP instead of after
	  full processing of the Payload

2009-08-14 22:11  toke-sb

	* [r1673]
	  
	  Enhancement: Updated ExtendDocumentFilter to handle small tweaks
	  to the added field content
	  Hack: Made it possible to select hos to access ARC-filed until
	  the ARCParser from heritrix is fixed or replaced

2009-08-14 21:48  toke-sb

	* [r1672]
	  
	  Enhancement: The Configuration discarded vital information from

	* [r1671]
	  
	  Added missing heritrix-libs

2009-08-11 14:36  toke-sb

	* [r1661]
	  
	  Added libs and tweaked ARCParser(Test)-code. The ARCParser is now
	  capable of extracting content. A bare minimum of meta-data are
	  extracted

2009-08-11 13:34  toke-sb

	* [r1660]
	  
	  Skeleton code for ARC-support (the Internet Archive variant, not
	  the compression format)

2009-08-11 12:34  mads-sb

2009-08-07 13:22  toke-sb

	* [r1654]
	  
	  Added IndirectIntsorter, which is a copy of IndirectLongSorter.
	  This was dictated by the use of the atomic long[]

2009-08-06 12:58  toke-sb

	* [r1651]
	  
	  Bugfix: The SortFactory.getSort() wasn't synchronized. As
	  initializing a sorter potentially takes a lot of time, there was
	  a real risk of doing double work on sort initialization on newly
	  opened indexes

2009-08-06 12:52  toke-sb

	* [r1650]
	  
	  Enhancement: Sorting on fields with no defined locale used a
	  standard Lucene Sort. This was changed to use Summa sorting,
	  which uses a more compact representation of values

2009-08-06 12:47  toke-sb

	* [r1649]
	  
	  Bugfix: When using a static IndexDescriptor, the sort pools for
	  the Lucene search node wasn't updated upon index change,
	  resulting in potentially faulty sorts

2009-08-06 11:47  toke-sb

	* [r1648]
	  
	  Cleanup of the IndexLookup, especially with regard to the sample
	  website.
	  The sample website not allows for easy testing of index lookup.

	* [r1647]
	  
	  Added newlines to the XML returned from IndexResponse

	  Improved logging for IndexLookup

2009-08-05 15:15  toke-sb

	* [r1645]
	  
	  Addition of a jps-page for handling index lookups, including
	  defining the call in the wsdd. The index lookup currently only
	  works from the command line

2009-08-05 13:47  toke-sb

	* [r1644]
	  
	  Connected the search web service to index lookup
	  Added sample query to SearchTool

2009-08-05 13:11  toke-sb

	* [r1643]
	  
	  Finished the index lookup with a basic unit-test and incorporated
	  the lookup mechanism into the facet search node

2009-08-05 09:07  toke-sb

	* [r1642]
	  
	  Slightly improved JavaDoc for TagHandler

2009-08-05 08:40  toke-sb

	  configurable default values and mapping from generic search
	  request

2009-08-05 08:14  toke-sb

	* [r1640]

	  Added formal definition, sample XML, response implementation and
	  search-keys for the index lookup searcher

2009-08-03 12:04  mkamstrup

	  Massive doc updates for RecordShaperFilter
	  
	  Tweak RecordShaperFilterTest to excersise the template system an
	  group matching a bit

2009-07-03 12:14  toke

	  Some work on Schemas

2009-07-03 11:50  mke

	* [r1631]
	  
	  Bugfix: Automagically free all RMI services registered via the
	  RemoteHelper when the JVM exits (this means pertty much all RMI
	  services). This should fix some bugs where the services refused
	  to come back up when started from a ClientShell, but killed with
	  'kill <pid>' from a Unix shell. The problem was that Java doesn't
	  do this clean up by default - go figure

	  Bugfix: Make DerbyStorage work again, this fixes #1595
	  "DerbyStorage broken in 1.3.0"
	  
	  This bugfix had some collateral effects:
	  - DerbyStorage now uses a client side paging model, speed tests
	  has yet to be performed
	  - H2Storage's internal MiniConnectionPoolManager subclass has
	  been merged back into the general MiniConnectionPoolManager, this
	  means that MCPM no longer uses StatementEventListeners as they
	  have proven unreliable in many JDBC drivers
	  - The method DatabaseStorage.getStatement() has been renamed to
	  getManagedStatement() to underline how its used
	  - The sql statements for paged queries are no longer using '?'
	  wildcard substitution, but the DatabaseStorage.getPagingStatement
	  directly inserts the page range

2009-04-21 21:29  mke

	* [r1336]
	  
	  Allow for clients to load their configurations sloppily, by
	  allowing gestSystemConfiguration() to search for a config. This
	  also allows one to specify the summa.configuration property in a
	  client.xml
	  spec file.
	  
	  In the Control module rename the concept of "client meta files"
	  to "client control files"
	  
	  Move client control files from the meta/ dir directly into
	  <clientId>/control.xml. This makes it way easier to remove
	  unwanted clients without having artifacts lying around
	  
	  Introduce new command in the control-shell, 'control', that can
	  inspect the contents of a client control file given a client id
	  
	  Add DEFAULT_REGISTRY_PORT to ClientConnection
	  
	  Make the ControlCore's ClientManager look up the client's
	  registry port by inspecting the control.xml and returning a
	  default value (27000) if it is undefined. This fixes an age old
	  warning issued about
	  hard coded client registry ports of 2700.

2009-04-21 18:46  tokerefind

	  ControlShell and add a better explanation of the formatting of
	  the target host parameter, basically

	  Prettify client status output in ControlShell, this is partially
	  achieved by simplifying the message in
	  InvalidClientStateExceptions
	  
	  Default to -l in the 'repo' command of ControlShell (which means
	  "list contents")

2009-04-20 09:11  mke

	  Bump Summa version to 1.3.2-rc
	  
	  Don't default to setting summa.configuration=configuration.xml in

	  the config if the system property summa.configuration is unset.

	  bundles specs (service.xml and client.xml) and other useful stuff

	  flushing records. It current fails and is considered a blocker
	  for 1.3.0

2009-03-20 10:37  mke

	* [r1128]
	  
	  Not only test the SummaKeywordAnalyzer.reusableTokenStream()
	  method in the unit tests, also the
	  SummaKeywordAnalyzer.tokenStream() method on the same input.

2009-03-20 09:34  mke

	* [r1127]
	  
	  Start updating the NEWS file preparing for the 1.3.0 relelase

2009-03-20 07:53  toke

	* [r1126]
	  
	  Refactoring: Moved the pool-framework to Common so that it can be
	  used for distributed term stats (next stop SBUtil)

2009-03-19 22:08  mke

	* [r1125]
	  
	  Do batch read() calls (ie. reading into an array) in
	  TransliterationFilter.next(). This gives a whopping 4x
	  performance boost in the AnalyzerPerformance app. The final
	  impact on indexing speed is yet to be measured.

2009-03-19 20:34  mke

	* [r1124]
	  
	  Super simple performancometer for Lucene analyzers

2009-03-19 18:55  mke

	* [r1123]
	  
	  Import German version of the LGPL v2.1, the idea is to use it for
	  performance testing our analyzers

2009-03-19 15:42  mke

	* [r1122]
	  
	  Add more tests with focus on white space handling

2009-03-19 15:14  mke

	* [r1121]
	  
	  Move deprecated tokenizers, TransliteratorTokenizer and
	  TokenMasker to attic.
	  
	  Lots of javadoc updates in the analyzers

2009-03-19 13:10  mke

	* [r1120]
	  
	  Slight cleanups in transliteration rules which should allow us to
	  use a CharArrayReplacer instead of a StringReplacer

2009-03-19 12:29  toke

	* [r1119]
	  
	  Tweak: Changed defaults for the PayloadQueues in MUXFilterFeeder
	  to 100 Payloads instead of 1 (the memory-limit default is 1MByte)

2009-03-19 11:50  mke

	* [r1118]
	  
	  Clearer output from storage-tool

2009-03-19 11:18  mke

	* [r1117]
	  
	  Micro logging tweak in RecordWriter
	  
	  Fix build of Web module (missing dep. on sbutil)

2009-03-18 14:23  toke

	* [r1116]
	  
	  Enhancement: Updates MARCMultiVolumeMerger and Transformer to
	  optionally remove namespaces in XML
	  Unit-test: Test for general call-back using XSLT's with SBUtil's
	  XSLT

2009-03-18 14:19  mke

	* [r1115]
	  
	  Bump sbutil to 0.4.3

2009-03-18 13:44  mke

	  Add unit tests on empty input strings, meaning zero tokens

2009-03-18 13:42  mke

	* [r1113]
	  
	  Less aggresive consolidation in the sample indexer bundles
	  
	  Make test-facet-index-1 only build facets on consolidate (which
	  will be done on close)
	  
	  Add a failed-records.log catching records failing to index in the
	  log4j.xml shipped with the sample bundles

2009-03-18 12:10  mke

	* [r1112]
	  
	  Fix a NPE in TransliteratingFilter.<init> and add unit tests to
	  catch it

2009-03-18 12:01  mke

	  Add beginnings of unit tests for SummaAnalyzer

2009-03-18 11:55  toke

	  Debug: Even more feedback for IndexControllerImpl

2009-03-18 11:46  toke

	  Debug: Even more feedback for IndexControllerImpl

2009-03-18 11:22  toke

	* [r1107]
	  
	  Debug: Better feedback for IndexControllerImpl

2009-03-18 10:02  mke

	* [r1106]
	  
	  Add SummaSearcherRunner - a helper class to launch a search
	  engine from the command line
	  
	  Tweak exception handling in StorageRunner

2009-03-18 09:56  mke

	* [r1105]
	  
	  Make StorageRunner.main() block forever after constructing the
	  storage. Also use commons-logging instead of stdout.

2009-03-18 09:49  mke

	* [r1104]
	  
	  Add a main() method to FilterControl so that we can run it as a
	  stand alone app

2009-03-18 08:41  toke

	* [r1103]
	  
	  Refactoring: Changed from XMLUtil to SBUtils XSLT

2009-03-17 21:08  mke

	* [r1102]
	  
	  Properly detect if we have a database already

2009-03-17 20:32  mke

	* [r1101]
	  
	  Roll Postgres and H2 jar files into the sample storage bundle

2009-03-17 20:28  mke

	* [r1100]
	  
	  Use H2Storage as the backend in the sample bundles

2009-03-17 19:54  mke

	* [r1099]
	  
	  Bump SBUtil to 0.4.2. This fixes all unit tests for for the
	  Lucene token/analyzer framework in Common

2009-03-17 15:09  mke

	* [r1098]
	  
	  Rebase the analyser framework on top of SBUtils new
	  ReplaceReaders. The unit tests will fail until we get SBUtil
	  0.4.2 into trunk.
	  
	  This commit marks the deprecation of TransliteratorTokenizer and
	  TokenMasker which should make the world a better place for
	  everybody :-)

2009-03-17 13:52  mke

	* [r1097]
	  
	  Implement a TokenReplaceFilter with unit tests. This is going to
	  deprecate TokenMasker sooner or later

2009-03-17 13:06  mke

	* [r1096]
	  
	  Update to sbutil 0.4.1

2009-03-17 12:24  mke

	* [r1095]
	  
	  Almost complete rewrite of TransliteratorTokenizer to use the new
	  features of SB Util 0.4.0
	  
	  Add unit tests for TransliteratorTokenizer. Two of them are
	  failing. Toke is investigating

2009-03-17 12:24  mke

	* [r1094]
	  
	  Almost complete rewrite of TransliteratorTokenizer to use the new
	  features of SB Util 0.4.0
	  
	  Add unit tests for TransliteratorTokenizer. Two of them are
	  failing. Toke is investigating

2009-03-17 10:01  mke

	* [r1093]
	  
	  Bump sbutil version to 0.4.0. This paves the way for a lot of
	  performance and memory usage improvements

2009-03-17 09:52  mke

	* [r1092]
	  
	  Bump version number to 1.3.0 (not released yet)
	  
	  Bump H2 dependency to 1.1.109. This is sadly not a "blessed
	  stable release" of H2, but it has proven very stable in our
	  tests. The new H2 fixes a performance degradation when scaling
	  storages past 2M records.

2009-03-17 09:49  mke

	* [r1091]
	  
	  Make H2Storage take a directory in which to place db files, and
	  not a direcoty+file_prefix. This makes it compatible with the way
	  the DerbyStorage does this. The relevant property is
	  'summa.storage.database.location'.
	  
	  Update tests to reflect this.

2009-03-17 09:11  mke

	* [r1090]
	  
	  Merge summa-db-transactions branch. This converts the
	  DatabaseStorage base class to use SQL transactions around its
	  flush() and flushAll() methods which drastically improves
	  performance of INSERT operations. On top of the
	  improved performance it also fixes a bug where only a subset of a
	  record's relations could bve committed if one of the relations
	  failed to commit.
	  
	  The branch merge also pulls in a new Storage impl, namely
	  VoidStorage.

2009-03-17 09:05  toke

	* [r1089]
	  
	  Bugfix: FileReader no longer marks folders as aldredy handled
	  (this might present problems with cyclic folder structures)

2009-03-12 13:10  toke

	* [r1088]
	  
	  Critical bugfix: The ServiceObj (responsible for handling
	  SOAP-requests) failed randomly on multi-threading

2009-03-12 07:06  mke

	* [r1087]
	  
	  Log a warning if ThreadedStreamParser is forced to call
	  Thread.sleep()

2009-03-11 15:47  toke

	* [r1085]
	  
	  First version of the TermStaExtractor, not complete and no
	  unit-tests yet

2009-03-11 14:05  toke

	* [r1084]
	  
	  Performance: Changed the default queue-size and sleep-time for
	  ThreadedStreamParser as the old defaults resulted in poor
	  performance

2009-03-11 13:21  toke

	* [r1082]
	  
	  Bugfix: The FileReader had a race-condition for closing and
	  renaming files that was triggered by the FileWatchers
	  multi-threaded usage of FileReader

2009-03-10 20:29  mke

	* [r1078]
	  
	  Import a very simple to to play around with JDBC and transactions

2009-03-06 16:02  toke

	* [r1077]
	  
	  Minor tweaks to FilewatcherTest

2009-03-05 13:52  mke

	* [r1076]
	  
	  Bugfix: AggregatingStorage did not support base=null in
	  getModificationTime() and getRecordsModifiedAfter(). Implement
	  this together with relevant unit tests.

2009-03-05 13:47  mke

	* [r1075]
	  
	  Bugfix: Fix compliance to ReadableStorage contract - to throw a
	  NoSuchElementException when the iter is depleted in next(iterKey)
	  and next(iterKey, maxRecords).

2009-03-04 22:42  toke

	* [r1074]
	  
	  Unit-tests and files for FileReader and FileWatcher now properly
	  committet

2009-03-04 22:32  toke

	* [r1073]
	  
	  Enhancement: FileReader and FileWatcher are low lazy with regard
	  to folder-traversal.
	  Unit-tests has been updated and passes.

2009-03-04 16:18  toke

	* [r1072]
	  
	  Enhancement: Changed FileReader to resolve files lazily.
	  Warning: The FileWatcher is currently broken because of this. I'm
	  working on a fix for this

2009-03-04 13:21  toke

	* [r1071]
	  
	  Unit-test: Added some extra test cases for wildcards and ranges
	  to the summaQueryParserTest.
	  Debugging: Added a more readable output for
	  ConstantScoreRangeQueries to the queryToString method

2009-03-04 12:35  toke

	* [r1070]
	  
	  Unit-test: Tests group-expansion and query time field boosting
	  for the SummaQueryParser. No bugs found.
	  Debugging: Copied a queryToString method to SummaQueryParser from
	  Stable Summa

2009-03-04 12:18  toke

	* [r1069]
	  
	  Cosmetics: Proper @Override-annotation and removal of non-used
	  import

2009-03-04 12:17  toke

	* [r1068]
	  
	  Bugfix: The IndexDescriptor class checked for changed descriptors
	  all the time when the check-interval was 0. The correct behaviour
	  is not to check when the interval is 0. Fixed.

2009-03-04 10:03  toke

	* [r1067]
	  
	  Made the FileReader auto-close delivered Streams when they reach
	  EOF. This guards against file handle starvation

2009-03-04 10:03  toke

	* [r1066]
	  
	  Added test to XMLSplitterFilter to see is it calls close on
	  processed Payloads (it does)

2009-03-03 15:21  toke

	* [r1065]
	  
	  Minor tweaks of the ScaleTest

2009-03-03 14:14  toke

	* [r1064]
	  
	  Unit-test: Changed the tests for discard filters to use them af
	  the more general ObjectFilters

2009-03-03 14:11  toke

	* [r1063]
	  
	  Bugfix: The AbstractDiscardFilter (and its subclasses) wasn't
	  actually ObjectFilters, they just had all the methods

2009-03-03 10:18  mke

	* [r1062]
	  
	  Bugfix: Fix handling of quoted arguments. This makes it possible
	  to do phrase searches with the search-tool.

2009-02-21 22:48  toke

	* [r1061]
	  
	  Bugfix: The FacetSearchNode did not open the TagHandlers in
	  read-only mode

2009-02-21 22:37  toke

	* [r1060]
	  
	  Cosmetics: Better looking XML from FacetResult

2009-02-21 22:28  toke

	* [r1059]
	  
	  Bugfix: Merging of DocumentResponses did not update the total
	  number of hits

2009-02-21 01:47  toke

	* [r1058]
	  
	  Changed the release test scale to clear tags on consolidate,
	  thereby enforcing the dirty add + cleanup method in DiskPool

2009-02-21 01:13  toke

	* [r1057]
	  
	  Changed the sorting strategy for DiskPool to use merge-sort
	  instead of head-sort. Coupled with a cache for persistent values,
	  this speeds up the sort after dirty adds tremendously

2009-02-20 11:41  toke

	* [r1056]
	  
	  Bugfix: The TagHandler didn't perform dirty adds when asked to do
	  so

2009-02-20 11:06  toke

	* [r1055]
	  
	  Changed log-level for RecordGenerator to trace for simple token
	  assignment

2009-02-19 14:42  toke

	* [r1054]
	  
	  Slightly better debug info

2009-02-19 13:44  nig

	* [r1051]
	  
	  Rettet lma_long type fra bog_art til artikel_i_bog i horizon og
	  nordicom

2009-02-19 11:29  toke

	* [r1049]
	  
	  Minor: Small change to ScaleTest

2009-02-19 11:05  toke

	* [r1048]
	  
	  Minor: Added reference-count to the meta information for the
	  Facet core map

2009-02-19 10:52  toke

	* [r1047]
	  
	  Minor: Added tag-count to the meta-information for persistent
	  facets

2009-02-19 10:42  toke

	* [r1046]
	  
	  Bugfix: The performance enhancement introduced an error with
	  extra tagIDs. Fixed.

2009-02-19 10:40  toke

	* [r1045]
	  
	  Performance: Moven array creation outside of a loop, whick should
	  lessen GC overhead

2009-02-19 10:33  toke

	* [r1044]
	  
	  Performance: The batch building of the Fact structure repeated
	  the exact same Tag look-up for each document that points to the
	  same Tag

2009-02-19 10:26  mads

	* [r1043]
	  
	  Added expansion of records when calling getRecord.
	  
	  Added getLegacyRecord to the public webservice. This method is
	  only meant to be used by legacy applications. New applications
	  must use getRecord.

2009-02-19 10:14  mads

	* [r1042]
	  
	  Use a more sensible logging path relative to the tomcat
	  installation

2009-02-19 09:55  toke

	* [r1041]
	  
	  Bugfix: The refactoring of the MarcMultiVolumeMerger didn't move
	  it to the proper module (Common)

2009-02-18 22:18  mke

	* [r1040]
	  
	  Build fix after moving the legacy xslt to Common

2009-02-18 15:24  toke

	  Added explicit flush on store in DiskPool

2009-02-18 15:24  toke

2009-02-18 13:21  mke

	* [r1029]
	  
	  Update config for scalability index test and add a bundle spec.
	  The actual bundle is build outside the Summa source tree though.

2009-02-18 12:48  toke

	* [r1028]
	  
	  Moved legacy-handling from the Index-module to the Common module.
	  This shouldn't break anything (*cough*)

2009-02-18 12:34  mke

	* [r1027]
	  
	  Fix documentation of the -x parameter to summa-bundletool

2009-02-18 12:21  mke

	* [r1021]
	  
	  Add options to RecordReader for deciding whether or not to
	  request parent/child expansion when receiving records. This is
	  untested, but the changes are fairly simple and I am pretty
	  confident that they are good.
	  
	  This fixes bug 1552: "Add an option to RecordReader to fetch
	  record parents/children"

2009-02-18 09:24  toke

	* [r1020]
	  
	  Renamed RelativesFilter to DiscardRelativesFilter

	  Added slightly better feedback to IndexControllerImpl

2009-02-17 08:06  toke

	  Added some comments to the FagrefGenerator unit test

2009-02-17 08:05  toke

	  Cosmetics

2009-02-17 08:03  toke

2009-02-13 11:55  toke

	* [r1014]
	  
	  Unit-test for custom port-specification for the SSHDeployer

2009-02-12 22:45  toke

	* [r1013]
	  
	  Updated SSHDeployer to support a custom port for SSH. Not
	  properly tested yet (need a Linux-machine for that)

2009-02-12 15:08  toke

	* [r1012]
	  
	  Bugfix: Assigning the same source multiple times to MUXFilter
	  resulted in the last Payloads of a stream of Payloads being
	  skipped under certain race-conditions

2009-02-12 14:52  toke

	* [r1011]
	  
	  Unit-test: A test demonstrating a bug in MuxFilter when setSource
	  is called multiple times

2009-02-12 14:51  toke

	* [r1010]
	  
	  Added finer grained debugging information to MUXFilterFeeder

2009-02-12 14:06  toke

	* [r1009]
	  
	  Bugfix: The round-robin used by the MUXFilter always selected the
	  first available finter

2009-02-12 12:25  toke

	* [r1008]
	  
	  Added unit-test to the muxer

2009-02-12 10:58  toke

	* [r1007]
	  
	  Created DelayFilter to throttle processing (and help with
	  testing)

2009-02-12 09:05  toke

	* [r1006]
	  
	  Cosmetics

2009-02-12 08:59  toke

	* [r1005]
	  
	  Better unit tests for the toXML/fromXML methods in RecordUtil.
	  Now with schema-validation of the output

2009-02-11 16:21  toke

	* [r1004]
	  
	  Created toXML and fromXML for Record in RecordUtil. Needs more
	  unit-testing

2009-02-10 22:23  mke

	* [r1003]
	  
	  Add a very rudimentary experiment with the HttpServer class
	  present in Java 1.6. This might serve as a base to create an
	  in-process REST API for Summa... TIme will tell...

2009-02-10 15:14  mke

	* [r1002]
	  
	  Logging tweaks involving a small amount of fiddling with the
	  logic for detecting the children

2009-02-05 19:09  mke

	* [r981]
	  
	  Alter the index on the mtime column to be a covering index on the
	  (mtime,base) tuple. This way we get proper performance even
	  though there are several bases in the same DB. With only an index
	  on mtime we have to (almost) do a table scan to get the records.
	  
	  With this change the first iterator lookup (ie. for mtime=0) will
	  still be "slow", 1-2s, but all following iterators (or internal
	  pages) will be very fast because you will have the correct mtime
	  offset from the last record.

	* [r958]
	  
	  Huge cleanup of the entire Lucene Analyzer/Tokenizer/Filter

	  things.
	  
	  Add a cache to RuleParser which checks if the rules to parse has
	  already been parsed and reuses them if so.
	  
	  Rename SummaRepeatAnalyzer to SummaFieldSeparatingAnalyzer
	  
	  Rename SummaSortKeyAnalyzer to SummaSymbolRemovingAnalyzer
	  
	  Make all Analyzer subclasses implement the
	  Analyzer.reusableTokenStream(String,Reader) method
	  
	  Make TransliteratorTokenizer only implement the
	  TokenStream.next(Token) and not TokenSteam.next()
	  
	  Make TransliteratorTokenizer not allocate new StringBuffers in
	  .next(Token), but simply reset the buffer with
	  StringBuffer.setLength(0)
	  
	  Add a CharSequenceReader with unit tests that acts as a Reader on
	  top of CharSequence implementors such as StringBuilder and
	  StringBuffer. This allows us to do a lot less object allocations
	  when altering terms in-memory using a StringBuffer and the likes

2009-01-28 13:37  mke

	* [r957]
	  
	  Import lucene-backports-2.4.0 into Summa libs. This is a custom

	  Start using Analyzer.reusableTokenStream() where possible in
	  Common. This is only partly possible because of the bad design of

	  IndexControllerImpl to the IndexManipulator interface
	  
	  Make IndexControllerImpl use the new ManipulatorFactory for
	  instantiating its manipulators
	  
	  Introduce a RemoteManipulator interface and a RMIManipulatorProxy
	  that can be used to expose a manipulator over RMI. The intention
	  is to be able to remote control commit() and consolidate() via
	  shell commands and WorkflowSteps in the Workflow module.
	  
	  Introduce properly defined default property valies in
	  RMIStorageProxy
	  
	  Make StorageFactory use the static getClass() method in
	  Configuration to avoid RMI mess-ups of class paths.
	  
	  Don't throw RemoteExceptions in StorageFactory when we should
	  really be throwing ConfigurationExceptions...

2009-01-22 07:54  mke

	* [r947]
	  
	  Add an "anonymous mode" to ResultSetCursor that does less verbose

	  Make scanRecord() handle empty strings in the parent/child
	  columns as NULL - this is needed when we do lazy relation lookups

2009-01-19 19:10  mke

2009-01-16 20:45  mke

	* [r917]
	  
	  WARNING: CHANGE OF DATABASE SCHEMA!
	  
	  Switch DatabaseStorage to use UniqueTimestampGenerator timestamps
	  instead of DATETIME columns. That is, use BIGINT columns with the
	  generated timestamps.
	  
	  This means that we can also add a UNIQUE index on the mtime
	  column - which again means that we can drop the "id" part of
	  "ORDER BY mtime,id".
	  
	  The longer term point of this is to allow super-fast paginated
	  iteration using only the mtime as keys for the rows.

2009-01-16 20:41  mke

	* [r916]
	  
	  Add a method for creating a base timestamp from a system time.

	  Fix connection pooling for PostgresStorage... Apparently the
	  PostgresQL JDBC driver silently ignores StatementEventListeners.
	  
	  In order to apply the above fix H2PreparedStatement was moved out
	  into the generic 'database' package as ManagedStatement. Now
	  Postgres applies the same workaround as H2 to get statement
	  pooling working.
	  
	  Fix another bug in the PostgresStorage related to integrity
	  constraints. Postgres, like H2, does not throw
	  IntegrityConstraintViolationExceptions when they occur, but use
	  standard SQLExceptions with a specific SQLState (really the error
	  code stored here instead of the errorCode variable of the
	  SQLException... wonder... wonder...)
	  
	  Add a method DatabaseStorage.destroyDatabase() that drops all
	  created tables. Ofcourse with a BIG caveat emptor in the docs!
	  This was needed to get the unit tests running for PostgresStorage
	  (which they now do by the way...)

	  Update usage of the lucene-core-2.4.0 Idea project library to
	  just call it 'lucene-core' in the Idea project files. This way we
	  can update Lucene versions without breaking the entire project.
	  
	  Make StorageStressTest use H2Storage instead. Test runs indicate
	  that H2 write speeds are comparable to Derby's, but that reading
	  is 2-3 times faster.
	  
	  Make DatabaseStorage use Statement.executeQuery() instead of the
	  generic Statement.execute() where appropriate. This may be a
	  slight optimization on some JDBC drivers.

	  Prepare the statement and connection for cursoring in

	  http://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/83/query.html#query-with-cursor
	  
	  This should hopefully fix the OOMException in PostgresStorage:

2009-01-15 13:53  mke

	* [r899]
	  
	  Make H2Storage responsible for creating its parent directories
	  itself (the unit test did this and H2 fails without it)

2009-01-15 13:53  mke

	* [r898]
	  
	  The overall summary of this commit is that H2Storage passes the
	  unit tests now...
	  
	  I added a new method
	  DatabaseStorage.isIntegrityConstraintViolation(SQLException e)
	  that is used to check if an SQLException represents a ICV. The
	  problem is that H2 does not use the standard JDBC ICVException
	  for this, but just some custom error codes.
	  
	  Fix StorageTest to put databases inside a root 'test_db'
	  directory. This fixes the cleanup of the H2 databases which do
	  not use the same layout as the Derby one...
	  
	  Rename H2 jar from datestamped version to 1.0.79 version stamped
	  name

2009-01-15 13:53  mke

	* [r897]
	  
	  Fix ANt build scripts to handle the new H2 dependency

2009-01-15 13:53  mke

	* [r896]
	  
	  Initial stab at a H2Storage. Unit tests still fail. This appears
	  to be primarily because we don't clean up properly after our
	  selves...

2009-01-15 13:53  mke

	* [r895]
	  
	  Remove unnecessary call to StorageBase.updateRelations(). The way
	  we work with the separate summa_Relations table it is redundant
	  to re-validate relations when records are added; in this strategy
	  the relations will always be in sync.

2009-01-15 13:53  mke

	* [r894]
	  
	  Make sure we don't double-close iterators by guarding the
	  ResultIterator.close() method with a check on stmt.isClosed()

2009-01-15 13:53  mke

	* [r893]
	  
	  Implement override of DatabaseStorage.touchParents() in
	  DerbyStorage that does manual looping over the parents. This
	  works around https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4007 and
	  fixes
	  https://gforge.statsbiblioteket.dk/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1533&group_id=8&atid=109

	  Bugfix: The time-granularity of the RecordReader was seconds.
	  This has been upped to milliseconds (which could potentially
	  stioll pose problems, but Java does not support epoch-based
	  timestamps with finer granularity). With seconds as granularity,
	  the RecordReader would request already processed Records upon
	  resuming from a prior run.

	* [r853]
	  
	  Major refactoring of the Configuration-system for handling lists
	  of sub-configurations. The old way was to provide a list of
	  Strings with key-values for the wanted sub-configurations. The
	  new way is to provide a list of sub-configurations directly.
	  Several release-tests does not work right now, as they are being
	  slowly refactored to be aware of the new format.

2008-10-23 13:32  toke

	* [r654]
	  
	  More work on MARC-parsing for the ingester. The first version of

	  WaitForStatusStep
	  
	  With this commit the workflow module is minimally feature
	  complete. But still untested...

2008-10-22 14:26  toke

2008-10-21 09:45  mke

	* [r644]
	  
	  Forgot to rename Workflow moduleinside its build.xml (was named
	  Storage)

2008-10-21 09:43  mke

	* [r643]

	  First shot at a StorageWatcher implementation. Only one unit test
	  (but it is passing :-))

2008-10-14 13:12  mke

	* [r638]
	  
	  Major revamp of ReadableStorage API:
	  
	  * Purge all Iterators from the API and use only long-handles
	  instead. This was needed to provide a clean separation of RMI
	  from the storage impl
	  
	  * Add a StorageIterator class that replaces the old
	  RecordIterator class. This is now a convenience wrapper for the
	  iterator keys returned by the ReadableStorage interface
	  
	  Other:
	  
	  * Update a lot of documentation in the core Storage APIs
	  
	  * Added QAInfo annotations of QA_NEEDED to all storage classes
	  
	  * Finish impl of AggregatingStorage
	  
	  * Add unit tests for AggregatingStorage (and fix the bugs they

	  More refactoring of the Stream-handling

2008-10-09 12:02  toke

	* [r624]
	  
	  Refactoring of Stream-handling in Ingest, making a cleaner
	  XMLSplitter-inplementation (and fixing a multiple-Record bug in
	  the process).

2008-10-08 14:25  toke

	* [r618]
	  
	  Prepared the road for MARC-handling

2008-10-08 10:59  mke

	  Records can now have multiple parents

2008-10-07 09:34  toke

	* [r616]
	  
	  Marked a lot of deprecated classes in Ingest as deprecated,
	  preparing the road for a full port of the old Stable Summa
	  filters

2008-10-07 09:05  toke

	* [r615]
	  
	  Upgraded LuceneFacetBuilder to handle indexed-only as well as
	  stored-only fields for rebuilding. The FacetBrowser should now be
	  up-to-speed with (and exceeding) the browser from Stable Summa

2008-10-07 07:36  toke

	* [r614]
	  
	  Added the options tokenize and compress to IndexField XML (used
	  in IndexDescriptor)

2008-10-06 12:52  toke

	* [r613]
	  
	  Made consolidate for Facets work with stored fields

2008-10-06 11:58  toke

	  FacetBrowser

2008-10-03 10:05  mke

	* [r610]
	  
	  Implement recrusive expansion of records with unit tests
	  
	  IMPORTANT: There has been a semantic change in how
	  Record.equals() work. It no longer compare context that is
	  storage-local (specifically mtime and ctime), it only compares
	  what can be considered data belonging to the record

2008-10-02 12:44  toke

	* [r609]
	  
	  Fixed a bug in Storage that made it impossible to get a working
	  iterator

2008-10-02 12:15  toke

	  Created a single static method for checking and potentially

2008-10-01 14:56  toke

	* [r607]
	  
	  Work on consolidating indexes (removing deletes and rebuilding
	  the Facet map). Not finished, as there seems to be a one-off
	  error in the Facet handling

2008-09-30 14:40  mke

	* [r606]
	  
	  Base implementation of record child expansion. Small collection
	  of unit tests pass. Needs more unit tests to check deep
	  expansion.

2008-09-30 13:45  mke

	* [r605]
	  
	  Complete overhaul of the Storage API. While trunk does indeed
	  still compile expect breakage. See

	  for details

2008-09-30 13:34  toke

	  Fixed a double-index bug in IndexController which became visible
	  after the clean up of the Lucene manipulator

2008-09-30 11:09  toke

	* [r602]
	  
	  Fix of bug #1475: The indexer fails on some updated documents.
	  This has the added feature of being a cleaner implementation that
	  delays commit of the index until an explicit commit from the
	  IndexController is requested.
	  Still not perfect, as a cache of recordIDs is maintained for the
	  opened index.

2008-09-30 09:09  toke

	* [r601]
	  
	  Added an explicit logging of failed Payloads to the indexing

	  copy with UTF-8 in upper case)

2008-09-14 19:23  toke
