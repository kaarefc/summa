About Summix
------------
Summix is a simple example of a Summa packaging. You can run it out of the
box to set up a search engine on top of the very small collection of OAI
data in the data/oai/minidump directory.

Running this example
--------------------
Start a Storage instance. The database will be stored in the summix directory
in the 'storage' folder:

  bin/summa-storage.sh config/storage.xml &

With the storage running in the background we are ready to put some data in it.
We start the ingester in the foreground because it exits quite quickly:

  bin/summa-filter.sh config/ingest.xml
  
When the ingester exits we are ready to index the data. This can also be done
in the foreground and takes only a little longer than the ingest:

  bin/summa-filter.sh config/indexer.xml

Assuming this all runs without errors we can now start the search engine in the
background:

  bin/summa-searcher.sh config/searcher.xml &

The suggestion engine does not require any of the other services and can be
started at any time simply by running:

  bin/summa-searcher.sh config/suggest.xml &


Testing the storage and search engine
-------------------------------------
If you are wondering how to search and/or retrieve the data here's how. Try
doing a test search:

  bin/search-tool.sh search.document.query=bar
  
With the sample OAI minidump this gives two hits (and a considerable amount of
XML on your console :-)).

If you drill into the result set you should be able to pull out a field called
'recordID'. I found one called:

  oai:doaj-articles:7286e8e5f5f74b32fe85c9915e5e4ad5

We can now extract this record in full from the storage by issuing:

  bin/storage-tool.sh get oai:doaj-articles:7286e8e5f5f74b32fe85c9915e5e4ad5
  
This should print out the original raw XML as found when the record was
ingested.

Tips and Tricks
---------------
Try running search-tool.sh and storage-tool.sh without arguments to get basic
usage tips. They can do a lot more than showed here.


Enjoy!
