About SBSolr
------------
SBSolr is a patched Solr war where java util logging has been replaced with logback.


Configuration
-------------
SBSolr is expected to be configured through the use of context environment entries but reasonable default values are
provided as a fallback.

Solr requires a way to find the location of its installation directory, this can be configured through the environment
variable SOLR_HOME or through JNDI lookup of 'solr/home'. When deployed in a Tomcat, configuration through the use of
JNDI is preferred.

SBSolr adds configuration of logging through JNDI lookup of 'solr/logback' to the standard Solr configuration. The
'solr/logback' context environment parameter can contain either a file or an url pointing to a logback configuration to
be included in the skeleton logback configuration included in the SBSolr war.

The file 'context.xml.default' contains a sample SBSolr configuration in the form of a Tomcat default context
The file 'logback-include.xml' contains a sample logback configuration.
