 * ClusterExtractorWorkflow.

 * The work flow looks something like this:
 * <ul>
 * <li> For each index machine:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li> run the ClusterBuilder.buildCentroids method;
 *      <li> copy the new local centroid data structure to a central location.
 *      </ul>
 * <li> Central: Call the ClusterMerger.mergeCentroidSets method.
 * <li> For each index machine:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li> copy the new full centroid datastructure to this machine;
 *      <li> call the local ClusterProvider update method.
 *      </ul>
 * </ul>
