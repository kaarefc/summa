Pre-ingest is used to bring data into a intestable form.<br>
Pre-ingest operations are chain-able in the ingest work flow (Filters).<br>
A pre-ingest filter-chain <strong>must</strong> always terminate in a state where all meta data to be further processed
is i <strong>valid</strong> XML and stored with the <code>.xml</code> file extension.<br>
This can be used to format conversion, data normalization/enrichments or what ever the implementor needs.<br>
To extend with your own Filter, simply implement the {@link dk.statsbiblioteket.summa.preingest.IngestFilter}<br>
interface and add the filter to the configuration.<br>
