2009-02-10 05:46  mke

	* [r996] build.properties:
	  
	  Post release version bump to 1.2.1

2009-02-09 13:46  mke

	* [r993] .[CPY]:
	  
	  Create the Summa 1.2 stable branch

2009-02-09 13:45  mke

	* [r992]
	  
	  Release Summa 1.2.0

2009-02-09 13:30  mke

	* [r991]
	  
	  Imrpove loggin in the query parser a wee bit and comment out some
	  unused code paths

2009-02-09 13:23  mke

	* [r990]
	  
	  Fix grave bug where reading into smaller arrays would return -1
	  on read() even though the underlying CharacterSequence still has
	  chars remaining. This closes:
	  https://gforge.statsbiblioteket.dk/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1550&group_id=8&atid=109

2009-02-09 11:59  mke

	* [r989]
	  
	  Improve logging in SummaQueryParser

2009-02-09 08:59  mke

	* [r988]
	  
	  Typo in Javadoc

2009-02-08 21:49  toke

	* [r987]
	  
	  Bugfix: Forgot to switch properly from CoreMapBuilder to
	  CoreMapBitStuffed in LuceneFacetBuilder

2009-02-06 14:50  mke

	* [r986]
	  
	  Initial import of NEWS file. We should really add the old release
	  announcements to this file as well...

2009-02-06 13:57  toke

	* [r985]
	  
	  Updated LuceneFacetBuilder to use CoreMapbuilder for builds

2009-02-06 13:32  toke

	* [r984]
	  
	  Added copyTo to CoreMap and implemented it for CoreMapBitStuffed
	  and CoreMapBuilder

2009-02-06 12:09  toke

	* [r983]
	  
	  Cosmetics

2009-02-06 12:08  toke

	* [r982]
	  
	  Unit-tested and bug-fixed CoreMapBuilder. While limited in
	  features, it seems solid

2009-02-05 19:09  mke

	* [r981]
	  
	  Alter the index on the mtime column to be a covering index on the
	  (mtime,base) tuple. This way we get proper performance even
	  though there are several bases in the same DB. With only an index
	  on mtime we have to (almost) do a table scan to get the records.
	  
	  With this change the first iterator lookup (ie. for mtime=0) will
	  still be "slow", 1-2s, but all following iterators (or internal
	  pages) will be very fast because you will have the correct mtime
	  offset from the last record.

2009-02-05 16:04  toke

	* [r980]
	  
	  Added initial version (poorly tested) of a CoreMapBuilder,
	  optimized for builds.
	  Refactored and micro-tweaked the whole CoreMap-framework (no
	  change in functionality or API)

2009-02-05 12:50  toke

	* [r979]
	  
	  Refactored the Nordicom-XSLTs to handle MARC21Slim instead of the
	  Nordicom-variant

2009-02-05 11:03  mke

	* [r978]
	  
	  Ooops, relations tracking exception logic was reversed... Fix it.

2009-02-05 10:41  mke

	* [r977]
	  
	  Add a new option summa.storage.database.disablerelationstracking
	  containing a list of bases which to except from
	  relations-bookkeeping. It is the hope that this may be a big
	  optimization for many bases implemented on top of simple DBMSs

2009-02-05 09:51  mke

	* [r976]
	  
	  Better logging

2009-02-04 13:01  toke

	* [r975]
	  
	  Bugfix: The request commit logic was flawed and triggered a
	  commit on every update under certain conditions

2009-02-04 12:18  toke

	* [r974]
	  
	  Added optional max buffer size in MB to the LuceneManipulator

2009-02-04 12:06  toke

	* [r973]
	  
	  Cosmetics

2009-02-04 12:02  toke

	* [r972]
	  
	  Added an optional skip updates to the facet builder, making it
	  possible to postpone facet building until commit or consolidate

2009-02-04 12:01  toke

	* [r971]
	  
	  Added an optional skip updates to the facet builder, making it
	  possible to postpone facet building until commit or consolidate

2009-02-03 13:59  mke

	* [r970]
	  
	  Fix handling of empty strings in SummaKeywordAnalyzer
	  
	  Better logging in SummaSymbolRemovingAnalyzer

2009-02-02 15:22  mke

	* [r969]
	  
	  Javadoc twiddling

2009-02-02 15:06  mke

	* [r968]
	  
	  Fix wrong application of sleep() time

2009-02-02 14:19  mke

	* [r967]
	  
	  Optimizations and bug fixes in the indexer plugins:
	  
	  - Make ISBM.isbnNorm() not use regex replace to replace "-" with
	  "". Also better error logging
	  - Big optimization in Normalize.normalize(). Skip the compilation
	  of 7 regexes and use a simple char/or statement and introduce
	  thread local StringBuffers for string handling
	  - In OpenUrlEscape don't use regex for simple string replacements
	  - In YearRange introduce a thread local StringBuffer for string
	  manipulations.
	  - In YearRange fix a big bug where only odd years where returned
	  in the calculated range string

2009-02-02 12:13  mke

	* [r966]
	  
	  Set a sensible thread name

2009-02-02 12:12  mke

	* [r965]
	  
	  Set the queue size in the MUXFilterFeeder to 10 (was 1)
	  
	  Set the MUXFilter POLL_INTERVAL to 10ms (was 200ms)

2009-02-02 10:26  mke

	* [r964]
	  
	  Unexport remote interfaces when killing a service

2009-02-02 10:16  mke

	* [r963]
	  
	  Clarify some stuff in the javadoc for the properties

2009-02-02 10:00  mke

	* [r962]
	  
	  Fix javadoc to specify that summa.filter.sequence.filters must
	  contain a list of sub-confs and not a list of names

2009-02-01 23:21  mke

	* [r961]
	  
	  Delete stale files that Idea forgets about

2009-02-01 14:37  mke

	* [r960]
	  
	  Convert performance logging in XSLTUtil to ms instead of ns
	  
	  Fix ns->ms conversion in IndexControllerImpl (divided by 1000
	  instead of 1000000)

2009-02-01 08:16  mke

	* [r959]
	  
	  Add more profiling info to the debug log of IndexXontrollerImpl
	  
	  Make the static 'log' final in DocumentCreatorBase

2009-01-29 15:42  mke

	* [r958]
	  
	  Huge cleanup of the entire Lucene Analyzer/Tokenizer/Filter
	  framework under Summa. This is guaranteed to break a lot of
	  things.
	  
	  Add a cache to RuleParser which checks if the rules to parse has
	  already been parsed and reuses them if so.
	  
	  Rename SummaRepeatAnalyzer to SummaFieldSeparatingAnalyzer
	  
	  Rename SummaSortKeyAnalyzer to SummaSymbolRemovingAnalyzer
	  
	  Make all Analyzer subclasses implement the
	  Analyzer.reusableTokenStream(String,Reader) method
	  
	  Make TransliteratorTokenizer only implement the
	  TokenStream.next(Token) and not TokenSteam.next()
	  
	  Make TransliteratorTokenizer not allocate new StringBuffers in
	  .next(Token), but simply reset the buffer with
	  StringBuffer.setLength(0)
	  
	  Add a CharSequenceReader with unit tests that acts as a Reader on
	  top of CharSequence implementors such as StringBuilder and
	  StringBuffer. This allows us to do a lot less object allocations
	  when altering terms in-memory using a StringBuffer and the likes

2009-01-28 13:37  mke

	* [r957]
	  
	  Import lucene-backports-2.4.0 into Summa libs. This is a custom
	  library containg the ASCIIFoldingFilter from Lucene 2.9.
	  
	  Start using Analyzer.reusableTokenStream() where possible in
	  Common. This is only partly possible because of the bad design of
	  that package. A major refactoring/rewrite is in order when we
	  have time. There should be BIG performance gains possible here...

2009-01-26 10:52  mke

	* [r956]
	  
	  Reduce logging for anonymous ResultSetCursors. Better javadocs
	  and comments for about anonymous cursor handling

2009-01-26 09:05  toke

	* [r955]
	  
	  Added not for optimizing TransliteratorTokenizer

2009-01-23 13:53  mke

	* [r954]
	  
	  Better logging of performance stats

2009-01-23 13:34  toke

	* [r953]
	  
	  Updates to SearchPerformance testing

2009-01-23 12:52  toke

	* [r952]
	  
	  JavaDoc-fixes, small tweaks to index

2009-01-23 12:27  toke

	* [r951]
	  
	  Updated LuceneManipulator to only use non-deprecated Lucene
	  methods

2009-01-23 11:38  mke

	* [r950]
	  
	  Create new class ManipulatorFactory to help instantiate
	  IndexManipulators
	  
	  Move the CONF_MANIPULATOR_CLASS property def. from
	  IndexControllerImpl to the IndexManipulator interface
	  
	  Make IndexControllerImpl use the new ManipulatorFactory for
	  instantiating its manipulators
	  
	  Introduce a RemoteManipulator interface and a RMIManipulatorProxy
	  that can be used to expose a manipulator over RMI. The intention
	  is to be able to remote control commit() and consolidate() via
	  shell commands and WorkflowSteps in the Workflow module.
	  
	  Introduce properly defined default property valies in
	  RMIStorageProxy
	  
	  Make StorageFactory use the static getClass() method in
	  Configuration to avoid RMI mess-ups of class paths.
	  
	  Don't throw RemoteExceptions in StorageFactory when we should
	  really be throwing ConfigurationExceptions...

2009-01-23 09:56  toke

	* [r949]
	  
	  Better commit/consolidate-handling in the IndexControllerImpl

2009-01-22 19:31  mke

	* [r948]
	  
	  More verbose logging on debug level. This is very much needed to
	  get some idea of the performance profile on without going to
	  trace level logging.

2009-01-22 07:54  mke

	* [r947]
	  
	  Add an "anonymous mode" to ResultSetCursor that does less verbose
	  logging. This is needed because we use some "intermediate" cursor
	  in DatabaseStorage which we are really not interested in stats
	  from.

2009-01-21 20:34  mke

	* [r946]
	  
	  Fix thread name of CursorReaper (was IteratorReaper)

2009-01-21 20:32  mke

	* [r945]
	  
	  Remember to bundle nested exceptions when cascading exceptions
	  upwards!

2009-01-21 20:30  mke

	* [r944]
	  
	  Add some much needed profile logging

2009-01-21 14:14  mke

	* [r943]
	  
	  Use a UNION instead of an OR in stmtGetRelatedIds in
	  DatabaseStorage. This should improve H2Storage performance
	  because H2 has problems optimizing OR statements correctly.
	  
	  Make logging statements in MiniConnectionPoolManager and
	  DatabaseStorage more profiler-friendly.

2009-01-20 21:23  mke

	* [r942]
	  
	  Output total # num records read in debug output

2009-01-20 12:59  mke

	* [r941]
	  
	  Resolve the last minor kinks in lazy relation resolution and make
	  H2Storage use it

2009-01-20 12:41  mke

	* [r940]
	  
	  WARNING: New database table layout!
	  
	  Add two methods hasChildren() and hasParents() to Record. This
	  allows the DatabaseStorage to not construct a gajillion
	  ArrayLists for eachRecord in each flush()
	  
	  Impl of lazy relation lookups more or less finished, now I just
	  need to test it and make H2Storage use the new features. Changes
	  include:
	  - Add hasRelations column to summa_records table
	  - Add code to make sure that hasRelations is always up to date
	  - Make scanRecord() resolve ids lazily if it makes sense AND it
	  is told to do so
	  - Impl helper methods to keep relation flag in sync:
	  markHasRelations(List<String> ids) and checkHasRelations(String
	  id)
	  
	  Fix bugs with invalid parameter list lengths in the SQL queries
	  of updateRecord() and createRecord()

2009-01-20 09:52  mke

	* [r939]
	  
	  Add lazyRelationLookup versions of stmtGetRecordsModifiedAfter
	  and stmtGetRecordsModifiedAfterAll (ie. versions without LEFT
	  JOINs)
	  
	  Implement a new method resolveRelatedIds(Record rec) that looks
	  up all the related ids of a record and updates its parent/child
	  id lists
	  
	  Make scanRecord() handle empty strings in the parent/child
	  columns as NULL - this is needed when we do lazy relation lookups

2009-01-19 19:10  mke

	* [r938]
	  
	  Start preparing for lazy relation lookups. Old codepaths are
	  unchanged (and should survive the whole deal without much
	  impact...)

2009-01-19 15:02  mke

	* [r937]
	  
	  Javadoc twiddling

2009-01-19 14:41  mke

	* [r936]
	  
	  Log iterator lookup times in 'peek' and 'dump' actions of
	  StorageTool

2009-01-19 14:30  mke

	* [r935]
	  
	  Count number of records dumped in StorageTool

2009-01-19 14:17  toke

	* [r934]
	  
	  Added a test-index for PerformanceTest

2009-01-19 14:16  toke

	* [r933]
	  
	  Changed all ReleaseTests to use the new StreamingDocumentCreator,
	  which is a lot faster than the old DocumentCreator

2009-01-19 13:51  toke

	* [r932]
	  
	  Cosmetics

2009-01-19 13:51  toke

	* [r931]
	  
	  Changed the LuceneSearchNode top open indexes in ReadOnly mode

2009-01-19 13:45  mke

	* [r930]
	  
	  In getRecordsModifiedAfter() set
	  stmt.setFetchDirection(ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD);
	  
	  In StorageTool prevent a NPE in printRecord()
	  
	  In StorageIterator fix a newly introduced bug that causes
	  infinite loops or all empty result sets... dum-da-dum...

2009-01-19 13:29  mke

	* [r929]
	  
	  Set the connection as readOnly in getRecordsModifiedAfter()
	  
	  Fix connection leak in case getRecordsModifiedAfter() aborts
	  because there are no updates detected

2009-01-19 12:43  mke

	* [r928]
	  
	  Fix bug when peeking on an undefined base

2009-01-19 12:31  mke

	* [r927]
	  
	  Add basic time reporting to StorageTool

2009-01-19 12:19  mke

	* [r926]
	  
	  Add method DatabaseStorage.getPageSize()
	  
	  Fix bug when preparing the statement
	  stmtGetModifiedAfterAllQuery, not wrapping it properly in case of
	  paging result sets
	  
	  More verbose logging in PagingCursor
	  
	  Add code to H2Storage to:
	  - Optimize table selectivity stats once every 100.000 flush()
	  - SET MAX_MEMORY_ROWS to 3xpageSize (to account for multiple
	  rows/record in case of relations in the result set)
	  
	  Allow for controlling the size of the prefetch buffer in
	  StorageIterator
	  
	  Allow StorageTool to peek on the 'null' base, ie. all bases
	  
	  Make StorageTool only fetch the rows it will display

2009-01-19 11:05  mke

	* [r925]
	  
	  Typo is property database.pagesize

2009-01-19 10:30  mke

	* [r924]
	  
	  make H2Storage use a paging result set model... Let the
	  performance tests commence!
	  
	  Implement row counting per page in PagingCursor, this makes for a
	  lot more useful debug output
	  
	  Make sure that StorageTest tests paging in testGetMoreRecords()

2009-01-19 10:17  mke

	* [r923]
	  
	  Move all ResultSet/cursoring logic out of DatabaseStorage and
	  into a subpackage of storage.database called "cursors"
	  
	  Introduce the method
	  DatabaseStorage.getRecordsModifiedAfterCursor() that takes a raw
	  mtimeStamp as generated by the UniqueTimestampGenerator
	  
	  Make DatabaseStorage.scanRecord() set the mtimeTimestamp on the
	  ResultSetCursor if it is present. This is used to obtain the raw
	  mtimeStamp for paging purposes inside PagingCursor
	  
	  Fix a few bugs with stale refs to statement.setTimestamp() where
	  we switched to using the 'long' timestamp generated by the
	  UniqueTimestampGenerator
	  
	  Fix handliong of empty iterators in DatabaseStorage.next()

2009-01-18 23:50  mke

	* [r922]
	  
	  Lots of work towards a client side paging model for
	  DatabaseStorage. The old server-side cursors approach has an
	  unchanged codepath and still works fine.
	  
	  Note that this works is very much WIP!

2009-01-18 21:27  mke

	* [r921]
	  
	  Reorder columns in SELECT clauses to actually be table-wise and

	  WARNING: CHANGE OF DATABASE SCHEMA!
	  
	  Switch DatabaseStorage to use UniqueTimestampGenerator timestamps
	  instead of DATETIME columns. That is, use BIGINT columns with the
	  generated timestamps.
	  
	  This means that we can also add a UNIQUE index on the mtime
	  column - which again means that we can drop the "id" part of
	  "ORDER BY mtime,id".
	  
	  The longer term point of this is to allow super-fast paginated
	  iteration using only the mtime as keys for the rows.

2009-01-16 20:41  mke

	  Fix connection pooling for PostgresStorage... Apparently the
	  PostgresQL JDBC driver silently ignores StatementEventListeners.
	  
	  In order to apply the above fix H2PreparedStatement was moved out
	  into the generic 'database' package as ManagedStatement. Now
	  Postgres applies the same workaround as H2 to get statement
	  pooling working.
	  
	  Fix another bug in the PostgresStorage related to integrity
	  constraints. Postgres, like H2, does not throw
	  IntegrityConstraintViolationExceptions when they occur, but use
	  standard SQLExceptions with a specific SQLState (really the error
	  code stored here instead of the errorCode variable of the
	  SQLException... wonder... wonder...)
	  
	  Add a method DatabaseStorage.destroyDatabase() that drops all
	  created tables. Ofcourse with a BIG caveat emptor in the docs!
	  This was needed to get the unit tests running for PostgresStorage
	  (which they now do by the way...)

	  Make StorageStressTest use H2Storage instead. Test runs indicate
	  that H2 write speeds are comparable to Derby's, but that reading
	  is 2-3 times faster.
	  
	  Make DatabaseStorage use Statement.executeQuery() instead of the
	  generic Statement.execute() where appropriate. This may be a
	  slight optimization on some JDBC drivers.

2009-01-15 13:53  mke

	* [r898]
	  
	  The overall summary of this commit is that H2Storage passes the
	  unit tests now...
	  
	  I added a new method
	  DatabaseStorage.isIntegrityConstraintViolation(SQLException e)
	  that is used to check if an SQLException represents a ICV. The
	  problem is that H2 does not use the standard JDBC ICVException
	  for this, but just some custom error codes.
	  
	  Fix StorageTest to put databases inside a root 'test_db'
	  directory. This fixes the cleanup of the H2 databases which do
	  not use the same layout as the Derby one...
	  
	  Rename H2 jar from datestamped version to 1.0.79 version stamped
	  name

	* [r895]
	  
	  Remove unnecessary call to StorageBase.updateRelations(). The way

	* [r656]
	  
	  Include a log4j.xml configuration in the bundled .jar file which
	  outputs to stdout
	  
	  Remember the log4j .dtd file in the .jar file or else log4j won't
	  work

2008-10-23 13:34  mke

2008-10-23 13:32  toke

	* [r654]
	  
	  More work on MARC-parsing for the ingester. The first version of

	  much in the infancy...

2008-10-21 09:45  mke

	* [r644]
	  
	  Forgot to rename Workflow moduleinside its build.xml (was named
	  Storage)

2008-10-21 09:43  mke

	* [r643]

	  First shot at a StorageWatcher implementation. Only one unit test
	  (but it is passing :-))

2008-10-14 13:12  mke

	* [r638]
	  
	  Major revamp of ReadableStorage API:
	  
	  * Purge all Iterators from the API and use only long-handles
	  instead. This was needed to provide a clean separation of RMI
	  from the storage impl
	  
	  * Add a StorageIterator class that replaces the old
	  RecordIterator class. This is now a convenience wrapper for the
	  iterator keys returned by the ReadableStorage interface
	  
	  Other:
	  
	  * Update a lot of documentation in the core Storage APIs
	  
	  * Added QAInfo annotations of QA_NEEDED to all storage classes
	  
	  * Finish impl of AggregatingStorage
	  
	  * Add unit tests for AggregatingStorage (and fix the bugs they

	  More refactoring of the Stream-handling

2008-10-09 12:02  toke

	* [r624]
	  
	  Refactoring of Stream-handling in Ingest, making a cleaner
	  XMLSplitter-inplementation (and fixing a multiple-Record bug in
	  the process).

2008-10-08 14:25  toke

	* [r618]
	  
	  Prepared the road for MARC-handling

2008-10-08 10:59  mke

	  Records can now have multiple parents

2008-10-07 09:34  toke

	* [r616]
	  
	  Marked a lot of deprecated classes in Ingest as deprecated,
	  preparing the road for a full port of the old Stable Summa
	  filters

2008-10-07 09:05  toke

	* [r615]
	  
	  Upgraded LuceneFacetBuilder to handle indexed-only as well as
	  stored-only fields for rebuilding. The FacetBrowser should now be
	  up-to-speed with (and exceeding) the browser from Stable Summa

2008-10-07 07:36  toke

	* [r614]
	  
	  Added the options tokenize and compress to IndexField XML (used
	  in IndexDescriptor)

2008-10-06 12:52  toke

	* [r613]
	  
	  Made consolidate for Facets work with stored fields

2008-10-06 11:58  toke

	  FacetBrowser

2008-10-03 10:05  mke

	* [r610]
	  
	  Implement recrusive expansion of records with unit tests
	  
	  IMPORTANT: There has been a semantic change in how
	  Record.equals() work. It no longer compare context that is
	  storage-local (specifically mtime and ctime), it only compares
	  what can be considered data belonging to the record

2008-10-02 12:44  toke

	* [r609]
	  
	  Fixed a bug in Storage that made it impossible to get a working
	  iterator

2008-10-02 12:15  toke

	* [r608]
	  
	  Created a single static method for checking and potentially
	  assigning a RMISecurityManager that allows all

2008-10-01 14:56  toke

	* [r607]
	  
	  Work on consolidating indexes (removing deletes and rebuilding
	  the Facet map). Not finished, as there seems to be a one-off
	  error in the Facet handling

2008-09-30 14:40  mke

	* [r606]
	  
	  Base implementation of record child expansion. Small collection
	  of unit tests pass. Needs more unit tests to check deep
	  expansion.

2008-09-30 13:45  mke

	* [r605]
	  
	  Complete overhaul of the Storage API. While trunk does indeed
	  still compile expect breakage. See
	  http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Roadmap/StorageApiOverhaul
	  for details

2008-09-30 13:34  toke

	* [r604]
	  
	  Added Unit-test for consolidation that fails, indicating a bug

2008-09-30 13:16  toke

	* [r603]
	  
	  Fixed a double-index bug in IndexController which became visible
	  after the clean up of the Lucene manipulator

2008-09-30 11:09  toke

	* [r602]
	  
	  Fix of bug #1475: The indexer fails on some updated documents.
	  This has the added feature of being a cleaner implementation that
	  delays commit of the index until an explicit commit from the
	  IndexController is requested.
	  Still not perfect, as a cache of recordIDs is maintained for the
	  opened index.

2008-09-30 09:09  toke

	* [r601]
	  
	  Added an explicit logging of failed Payloads to the indexing

	  copy with UTF-8 in upper case)

2008-09-14 19:23  toke
