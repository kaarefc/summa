When moving or restarting the storage server, remember to update
controllucene.properties (directory_name and create_new_index).

On restart also remember to check (in /tmp/) if there is an old write
lock and delete it.

If you want to use IDEA for testing, remember to add the config
directory to the module libraries in project settings.
